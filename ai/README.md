# AI-Assisted Development

This directory contains resources for AI-assisted development used throughout the Deployment Infrastructure blog series.

## Contents

- **prompts/** - Prompt templates for local LLM usage
  - Organized by blog entry
  - Includes usage examples and best practices
  - Safety guidelines and review checklists

## Purpose

Document the use of AI tools (particularly local LLMs) to:
- Accelerate development of infrastructure code
- Generate configuration boilerplate
- Draft documentation and runbooks
- Explore architectural alternatives
- Create test scenarios

## Approach

We use **local LLMs** (via Ollama) to maintain:
- **Privacy** - Code never leaves your infrastructure
- **Control** - Full control over models and data
- **Cost-effectiveness** - No API fees
- **Learning** - Understand AI capabilities and limitations

## Getting Started

See [prompts/README.md](prompts/README.md) for:
- Setup instructions
- Usage workflows
- Safety guidelines
- Best practices

## Philosophy

AI is used as a **development accelerator**, not a replacement for:
- Human judgment and review
- Security validation
- Architecture decisions
- Quality assurance

All AI-generated content undergoes:
1. Critical review
2. Security validation
3. Functional testing
4. Documentation of changes
